		<h2>Potato Salad Recipe</h2>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Potatoes</li>
			<li>Mayonaise</li>
			<li>Hard-boiled eggs – peeled and chopped</li>
			<li>Sweet onion – diced</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Start the potatoes in a large pot of cold water and bring them to a boil to ensure even cooking. Make sure to salt the boiling water so the salty flavor gets deep down in the potatoes.</li>

			<li>Next, mix all the dressing ingredients together in a large bowl. Use your favorite mayonnaise as the base.</li>

			<li>Mix the potatoes and the dressing while the potatoes are still warm. Add chopped hard-boiled eggs for richness, celery for crunch, sweet onions for a zippy bite, and fresh chopped dill for a herbaceous punch.</li>

			<li>Finally, potato salad, any potato salad, tastes better on the second day after the flavors have had ample time to mix and mingle.</li>
		</ol>
